🌦️ About the Project

The ClimaView Dashboard is a real-time web application that provides accurate weather information for any city worldwide. It fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a 5-day forecast. The dashboard also dynamically changes its background images based on weather conditions, creating a visually engaging and user-friendly interface.

This project demonstrates the integration of APIs, geolocation, and dynamic DOM manipulation to deliver an interactive and practical web tool. It’s ideal for learning how to combine front-end development with real-time data handling.
